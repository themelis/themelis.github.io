### Welcome to my homepage!


![me](/images/dscn2366_2_.jpg){:class="img-inline"}

I am a zealous reader of statistical machine learning articles. I often express my thoughts in machine language. 

I have been a postdoc researcher at the [Cosmostat](http://www.cosmostat.org/) laboratory in CEA Paris-Saclay during 2017-2020, and the [IAASARS](https://www.astro.noa.gr/en/main/) of the National Observatory of Athens during 2012-2017.

My research interests are in the area of statistical signal processing and probabilistic machine learning with application to image processing, adaptive estimation and astrophysics.

To learn more, check out the [research](https://themelis.github.io/research.html "research") page, publication [list](https://themelis.github.io/publications.html "pubs") and my [CV]( https://themelis.github.io/shortbio.html "contact").

You can also find me in [Google Scholar](http://scholar.google.gr/citations?user=q6vZ-pwAAAAJ&hl=en "scholar"), [Linkedin](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/konstantinos-themelis/13/625/266 "linkedin") and [ORCiD](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-0090-4312 "ORCiD").
