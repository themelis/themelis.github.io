dfsffdsHydeout updates the original [Hyde](https://github.com/poole/hyde)
theme f

fdsfsdf

or [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) 3.x and adds new functionality.

### Keep It Simple

In keeping with the original Hyde theme, Hydeout aims to keep the overall
design lightweight and plugin-free. JavaScript is currently limited only
to Disqus and Google Analytics (and is only loaded if you provide configuration
variables).

Hydeout makes heavy use of Flexbox in its CSS. If Flexbox is not available,
the CSS degrades into a single column layout.
